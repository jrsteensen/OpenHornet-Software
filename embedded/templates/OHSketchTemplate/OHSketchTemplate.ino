 * @brief The following #define tells DCS-BIOS that this is a RS-485 slave device.
 * It also sets the address of this slave device. The slave address should be
 * between 1 and 126 and must be unique among all devices on the same bus.
 *
 * @bug Currently does not work with the Pro Micro (32U4), Fails to compile.
